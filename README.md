Castlevania:
These Lua script files force item drops in the various GBA/DS Metroidvania-style Castlevania titles. They are designed to work with BizHawk 2.9.1. Creating these required knowledge of ARM assembly as well as reverse-engineering. In creating these, I used Mesen and no$gba as my GBA and DS emulators respectively. (Yes, I only used no$gba for DS, and not GBA, because Mesen is much better but only supports GBA, whereas no$gba supports both GBA and DS.)

Kiseki:
Cheat Engine files for the Trails/Kiseki series. Contains spoilers for the respective games.
